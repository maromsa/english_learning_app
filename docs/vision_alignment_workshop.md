### Vision & Alignment Workshop Brief

**Purpose**
- Align product, design, engineering, data, and go-to-market stakeholders on target users, core value propositions, success metrics, and MVP scope for the AI-driven learning app.
- Produce tangible artifacts (personas, value-prop canvas, metrics tree, MVP definition) to guide subsequent roadmap execution.

**Desired Outcomes**
- Shared understanding of priority user segments and their jobs-to-be-done.
- Agreement on differentiating AI capabilities and corresponding risks/assumptions.
- Draft success metrics framework with owners and instrumentation status.
- MVP pillars, guardrails, and must-have features documented with decision rationale.

**Participants & Roles**
| Role | Primary Contact | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executive Sponsor | _TBD (e.g., Head of Product)_ | Frame strategic context, approve scope and success criteria. |
| Product Lead | _TBD_ | Facilitate workshop, synthesize decisions into roadmap inputs. |
| Engineering Lead | _TBD_ | Validate technical feasibility, surface architectural considerations. |
| Design/UX Lead | _TBD_ | Represent user insights, prototype constraints, accessibility needs. |

- Risk & assumption log with validation plan.

**Post-Workshop Follow-Up**
- Publish workshop notes and artifacts within 24 hours (owner: Product Lead).
- Assign action items with deadlines in the project tracker (owner: PMO/Product Ops).
- Schedule validation sessions for top risks (e.g., AI accuracy, data privacy) (owner: Data/AI & Compliance).
- Update overall product roadmap and share with leadership within one week (owner: Product Lead).
