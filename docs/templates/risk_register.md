### Risk & Assumption Register Template

| ID | Risk / Assumption | Category | Impact | Likelihood | Owner | Mitigation / Validation Plan | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | _e.g., AI model misclassifies user-generated images_ | Technical | High | Medium | Data/AI Lead | Prototype accuracy tests across demographics | In progress | Sample annotation plan needed |
| A-02 | _e.g., Users value map-based progression over linear lists_ | Product | Medium | High | Product Lead | Run A/B test with prototype | Not started | Recruit testers |

**Guidelines**
- Assign unique IDs and categorize (technical, product, market, compliance, operational).
- Rate impact and likelihood using a consistent scale (e.g., Low/Medium/High or numeric values).
- Define clear mitigation or validation steps with target dates.
- Track status updates after each checkpoint or experiment.
- Link to supporting documents (user research, experiment results, legal opinions).
